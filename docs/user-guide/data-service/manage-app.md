2. In the left navigation bar, select **Data Services** > **Application List**.

3. At the top right of the page, click **Create Application**.

   * **Edit**: You can edit the application's name and description information.
   * **Details**: You can view detailed information about the API services contained in the application, such as the publication status, etc.
   * **Delete**: If the current application contains API services, you need to transfer the API services to other applications in the pop-up dialog before you can delete them.
