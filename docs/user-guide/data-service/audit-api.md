# Service Auditing

Service auditing is primarily used to view the access records of APIs. You can view the records of each request, including access type, personnel, IP address, access time, access result, failure reason, etc. You can also filter according to different conditions.

Log in to the Tapdata platform and click **Data Services** > **Service Audit** on the left side of the page to view.
