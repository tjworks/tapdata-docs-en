# Task Pre-check Explanation

To ensure the normal operation of data replication/development tasks, when you save or start a task, Tapdata will conduct a pre-check based on node configuration and data source characteristics. Simultaneously, it prints the check results through logs, helping you avoid the risk of task execution failure and manage tasks more efficiently.

## Example of Pre-check Logs

After the data replication/development task configuration is completed, execute save or start the task, and the pre-check information will be displayed at the bottom of the page. Relevant examples are as follows:

## Task Settings Check

| Check Item                 | Log Example                                                  |

| Target Connection Status Check | 【ERROR】【2023-01-01 00:00:00】【Target Connection Status Check】【Node-Target】The data connection of this node is unavailable, the task cannot start normally, please check the relevant issues. { Data source login permission check failed: Wrong username or password } |
| Target Model Load Check        | 【ERROR】【2023-01-01 00:00:00】【Target Model Load Check】【Node-Target】The data model loading of this node failed, the task cannot start normally, please check the relevant issues. { Table Name 1; Table Name 2 } |
| Target Type Mapping Failure    | 【WARN】【2023-01-01 00:00:00】【Target Type Mapping Check】【Node-Target】【Personinfo】【id】The data type of this field is temporarily unsupported, and will be ignored during data writing. |
