# Step 3: Create a Data Pipeline

Tapdata allows you to synchronize data from various sources and process it during the data flow. Based on your business needs, you can create different tasks such as:

| Task Type | Applicable scenario |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Create a data replication task](../user-guide/data-pipeline/copy-data/create-task.md) | Real-time synchronization between similar or heterogeneous data sources can be achieved easily in a few simple steps. This capability is well-suited for various business scenarios such as data migration/synchronization, data disaster recovery, and improving reading performance. |
| [Create a data pipeline](../user-guide/data-pipeline/data-development/create-task.md) (Beta)  | A variety of processing nodes can be added between source/target data sources. These nodes provide advanced data processing capabilities such as data splitting, merging, field addition, and deletion, and shared mining.  |
