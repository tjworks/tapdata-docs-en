With the digital transformation of enterprises, traditional applications and architectures are no longer able to meet the needs of businesses, and the issue of data silos has emerged as the most significant challenge.

In the past, delivering data often required substantial time and effort to customize ETL logic or scripts. However, these capabilities were often not easily reusable in other business scenarios and necessitated repetition when requirements changed. Consequently, enterprises now seek a user-friendly approach to uniformly manage their data pipelines and achieve efficient data flow.

Tapdata offers real-time data services that seamlessly integrate data replication and data transformation. It enables millisecond-level real-time data synchronization and data fusion across clouds, regions, and multiple types of databases.
