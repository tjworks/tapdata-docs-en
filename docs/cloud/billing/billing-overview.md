# Billing Overview

This article introduces billing information such as billing items, billing methods and price descriptions in Tapdata Cloud.

## Billing method

Tapdata Cloud charges based on the **specifications** and **number** of Agent instances you want to subscribe. You will get 1 Agent instance upon completing account registration, and you have the option to purchase additional Agent instances through monthly, annual, consecutive monthly, or consecutive annual subscriptions to meet your business requirements.

There are several subscription options available for Tapdata Cloud:

- **One Month Only**: This is a one-time purchase of a one-month service. The subscription will not automatically renew after the expiration and can be manually renewed if desired.
- **One Year Only**: This option allows for a one-time purchase of a one-year service. The subscription will not automatically renew after the expiration and can be manually renewed when needed.
- **Monthly**: With the monthly subscription option, you pay a monthly fee. The subscription fee for the next month will be automatically deducted before the due date, ensuring uninterrupted service.
- **Annually**: The annual subscription option requires paying the subscription fee once a year. Similar to the monthly option, the subscription fee for the next year will be automatically deducted before the due date, providing convenience and continuity.

:::tip

When you select the recurring monthly or annual billing method, Tapdata Cloud will automatically deduct the subscription fee for the next billing cycle on the expiration date of each period. You can conveniently review the charge details in the **user center**, allowing you to stay informed about the payment information and have a clear understanding of the billing process for your Tapdata Cloud subscription.
