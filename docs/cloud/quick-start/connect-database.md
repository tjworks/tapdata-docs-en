# Step 2: Connect Data Sources

Once you have [installed the Agent](install-agent), you need to connect the Agent to the data sources through Tapdata Cloud, and you can create a data pipeline once the connection has been established.

:::tip

Before connecting to the data sources, you also need to ensure that the network environment is accessed properly and complete the authorization of the database account. For more information, see [Preparation](../prerequisites/README.md).

## Procedure

1. Log in to [Tapdata Cloud](https://cloud.tapdata.io/).

2. In the left navigation panel, click **Connections**.

3. On the right side of the page, click on **Create**. A dialog box will appear, where you can select the desired data source to establish a connection with.

4. After being redirected to the connection configuration page, proceed to fill in the required data source connection information. 

   On the right panel of the page, you will find helpful information and guidance regarding the configuration of the connection.

   The operation process will be demonstrated using MySQL as an example. For more examples, see [Connect Data Sources](../user-guide/connect-database/README.md).

   * **Exclude tables**: Once you have enabled the switch, you can configure the tables to be excluded by specifying their names, separated by commas (,) if there are multiple tables.
   * **Agent settings**: Defaults to **Platform automatic allocation**, you can also manually specify an agent.

5. Click **Connection Test** at the bottom of the page, and when passed the check, click **Save**.
